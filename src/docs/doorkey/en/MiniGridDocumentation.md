## Description

This environment has a key that the agent must pick up in order to unlock a door and then get to the green goal square. This environment is difficult, because of the sparse reward, to solve using classical RL algorithms. It is useful to experiment with curiosity or curriculum learning.

## Mission Space

“use the key to open the door and then get to the goal”

## Action Space

| Num | Name    | Action                    |
| --- | ------- | ------------------------- |
| 0   | left    | Turn left                 |
| 1   | right   | Turn right                |
| 2   | forward | Move forward              |
| 3   | pickup  | Pick up an object         |
| 4   | drop    | Unused                    |
| 5   | toggle  | Toggle/activate an object |
| 6   | done    | Unused                    |

be careful: to pickup the key you need to use the action "pickup" in an adjacent position while facing the key.

## Observation Encoding

- Each tile is encoded as a 3 dimensional tuple: `(OBJECT_IDX, COLOR_IDX, STATE)`
- `OBJECT_TO_IDX` and `COLOR_TO_IDX` mapping can be found in [minigrid/core/constants.py](https://minigrid.farama.org/_modules/minigrid/core/constants/)
- `STATE` refers to the door state with 0=open, 1=closed and 2=locked

## Rewards

Original MiniGrid: `R = 1 - 0.9*(step_count / max_steps)` on goal, `0` otherwise.
In our deterministic normalized MDP for \(V_*\) we use `r=1` exactly when the next state is the goal and `0` otherwise (with \(\gamma=0.99\)), so \(V_*(s)\in[0,1]\) and the definition \(v_*(s)=\mathbb{E}[G_t\mid S_t=s]\) holds without step scaling.

## Termination

The episode ends if any one of the following conditions is met:

1. The agent reaches the goal.
2. Timeout (see `max_steps`).
